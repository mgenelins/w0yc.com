It has 65 watts power output, and is on a commercial high-gain antenna on Moos Tower on the East Bank of the University of Minnesota. There is a flurry of activity on 444.425 KA0KMJ/R making this the second most popular UHF repeater in the Twin Cities. (Only behind 444.100 W0EF/R on the Interchange Building in the west metro.) Tune in and talk to the young hipsters. Be forewarned, however; there's no round-table or over-identification here! This machine has EchoLink. Echo link node number 192344.

We have upgraded the duplexer so that it now covers similar to a ham-radio mobile radio at a noisy (high up) site. Mobile coverage of Mpls, Edina, Shoreview, is 80%. Voice, however, seems to be having troubles as a design flaw in the UHF RF deck is causing the transmitter to munge up the synch perceived at the receiver. Call signs come across as does text messaging, and gateway traffic from call signs outside the area is a near daily occurrence. December 14, 2007: (previously an analog machine) W0YC This is a Icom D-star system. Gateway coming Jan / Feb 2008.

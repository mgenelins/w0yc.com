The Gopher Amateur Radio Club at The University of Minnesota is a technology-focused amateur radio club. We push forward cutting edge analog and digital repeater systems with wide area coverage in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. We are primarily focused on building infrastructure that other amateur radio operators and clubs use.
